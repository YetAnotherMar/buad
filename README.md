# buad
The Back Up Automatically Drive, or BUAD, is USB drive that when plugged into a Wycliffe Associates (WA) issued Bible Translation Tools (BTT) laptop, can backup all of the .tstudio files from BTTWriter onto itself.  The program creates a folder tree that separates files based on computer and date.

Files will be saved in a folder structure exampled below

D:/all/bttw/(Computer Name)/20YYMMDD-HHMM/

All of the files in this repo should be put onto a USB drive.

Setup Directions:
Set the unique name of the PC in the properties of "This PC"
Plug in the USB drive with this program on it.
Drag the BAUD file from the drive to the desktop. (This will be the file that you open when you want to run the program.)
It's set up

You can copy the files to another USB drive and the same desktop shortcut will work with that drive.
