The Back Up Automatically Drive, or BUAD, is USB drive that when plugged into a Wycliffe Associates (WA) issued Bible Translation Tools (BTT) laptop, can backup all of the .tstudio files from BTTWriter onto itself.  The program creates a folder tree that separates files based on computer and date.

Files will be saved in a folder structure exampled below

D:/all/bttw/(Computer Name)/20YYMMDD/



All of the files in this repo should be put onto a USB drive.
